# Solstr√•le
A ray tracer implemented in Golang compiled to WebAssembly with a web interface to start and view the render as it progresses.

The rendering is multithreaded in the browser by executing multiple web workers each rendering a part of the image.

Still basic rendering, as can be seen in the example. Only diffuse and metallic materials and no light sources.
